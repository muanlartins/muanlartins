description: Reading and changing OBS on the stream PC from WSL through obs-websocket - status, stats, scenes, audio tracks - without leaking its password. Use whenever OBS needs to be checked or changed.

# OBS from WSL

```sh
node scripts/obs.mjs                    # live? recording? scene, fps, skipped frames, CPU
node scripts/obs.mjs '[["GetSceneList", {}], ["GetInputList", {}]]'
```

- It reaches Windows at WSL's default route (`OBS_HOST` overrides) on port 4455, and reads the password
  from OBS's own config (`…\obs-studio\plugin_config\obs-websocket\config.json`). **Never print the password**
  or put it in a file, command line or the repo; the script masks the overlay keys (`#chave=`, `#obs=`) in what
  it prints. The Σ key and the Twitch Alerts Box URL are secrets too.
- Reading is always fine. **Changing** OBS (scenes, inputs, filters, audio tracks, output settings,
  starting/stopping the recording or stream) is Luan's call: ask first, and while he's live only make the change
  he asked for. Never restart or close OBS while he's live.
- Audio tracks are a bitmask per input (`SetInputAudioTracks` with `{"1": true, …, "6": false}`): 1 Tudo,
  2 Microfone, 3 Jogo, 4 Discord go to the recording; 5 "Live" is the stream's only. Music (the "Spotify" source)
  is on 5 alone.
- Changes made by hand or by websocket should also land in `brand/twitch/obs.py`, which generates the scene
  collection (`python3 brand/twitch/obs.py [stinger path] [alerts URL] > muanlartins.json`; the alerts URL is a
  secret: pass it on the command line, never commit it).
- Useful requests: `GetStats` (fps, `renderSkippedFrames`, `outputSkippedFrames`, CPU), `GetStreamStatus`
  (`outputSkippedFrames`, `outputCongestion`), `GetRecordStatus`, `GetSceneItemList`, `CreateRecordChapter`
  (Hybrid MP4, OBS 30.2+).
