## Luan Martins

As a Software Engineer with a strong foundation in both backend and frontend development, I thrive in dynamic environments where versatility and specialization are key. I have successfully contributed to both traditional web applications and blockchain technologies. 

A graduate with Magna Cum Laude honors in Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, I am driven by a passion for continuous learning and a commitment to delivering high-quality solutions. 

Fluent in English and with a growing proficiency in French, I am eager to expand my professional horizons and make impactful contributions to innovative projects.
