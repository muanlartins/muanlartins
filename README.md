## Luan Martins

This used to be an AI-assisted description of me. But I realized how cringe it was and opted for speaking from the heart.

Most of my work is proprietary, which means I can't share what represents the bulk of my knowledge. I still haven't ventured into the Open Source world, so what you'll see here are my basic personal projects and studies.

I would like to highlight the Agora project, which is a full solution for the UFRJ's debate society, SDUFRJ. It is a platform that challenged me in all aspects: UI, API, database and even domain hosting.
